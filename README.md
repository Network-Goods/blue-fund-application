Instructions:
- Fork repository 
- In the new fork create a copy of the application template (/src/application.md) if you are using github web interface, you will need to create a new file and copy the content of that template inside the new one
- Name the file after your project myproject_name.md
- Fill out the template with the details of your project, the more you provide, the faster we can make a decision 
- Once youâ€™re done, create a pull request. The pull request should only contain one new file- the markdown file you create from the template. 
- You will see the comment template that contains a checklist
